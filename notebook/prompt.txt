Analyze the user’s {language} proficiency level by creating 5 questions that effectively assess user's knowledge and understanding at various levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
            Provide questions that analyze grammar, vocabulary, comprehension.

            Follow these guidelines:
            - Generate the questions in json format. example {{"question":[question1,question2......]}}.
            - Each question should progressively explore the user's familiarity with grammar, vocabulary, comprehension, and language usage.
            - The questions should be clear and specific to {language} to accurately gauge the user’s level, ranging from beginner to advanced.
            - Do not add any commentary or introductory text. only the questions in list format should be generated.

    topics: List[str] = Field(description="List of topics covered in this chapter")
    activities: List[str] = Field(description="List of activities for practice in this chapter")

class Curriculum(BaseModel):
    chapter1: Chapter = Field(description="Content for Chapter 1")
    chapter2: Chapter = Field(description="Content for Chapter 2")
    chapter3: Chapter = Field(description="Content for Chapter 3")

class CurriculumFilter(BaseModel):
    chapter_curriculum: List[Union[Chapter, Curriculum]] = Field(description="List of chapters or curricula")
